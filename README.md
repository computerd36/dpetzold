# Deniz Petzold Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website hosted at [dpetzold.dev](https://dpetzold.dev). This website showcases my projects, skills, and contact information.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (with TypeScript)
- **NextUI** (for UI components)
- **Framer Motion** (for animations)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. You can view it in the browser by navigating to http://localhost:5173.

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash

This will generate optimized static assets in the out folder.
